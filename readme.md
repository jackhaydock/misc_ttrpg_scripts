# Misc Scripts

#### 5eTool Homebrew Item Count
Count the number of items of each type in a 5eTools homebrew collection. Currently done via URL. The example URL is this my homebrew collection [here](https://github.com/jackhaydock/Jackalope_Homebrew).

#### Dice Reroll
Show the odds of various outcomes when choosing to reroll a die. Can account for usual dice, like elemental adept (a 1 becomes a 2) or reliable talent (>10 becomes 10).

#### Rolltable Odds
Show the odds on a rolltable where some outcomes have larger ranges than others.

#### Spellname Generator
Generate random spell names, loosely in 5e convention. Currently just makes names, I might make it more configurable from the CLI eventually.
```
pip install names wonderwords
python spell_name_generator.py <# of names to make>
```
